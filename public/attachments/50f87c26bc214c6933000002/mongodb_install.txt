==> Caveats
If this is your first install, automatically load on login with:
mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents
cp /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb/2.0.3-x86_64/homebrew.mxcl.mongodb.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mongodb.plist

If this is an upgrade and you already have the homebrew.mxcl.mongodb.plist loaded:
launchctl unload -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mongodb.plist
cp /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb/2.0.3-x86_64/homebrew.mxcl.mongodb.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mongodb.plist

Or start it manually:
mongod run --config /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb/2.0.3-x86_64/mongod.conf

The launchctl plist above expects the config file to be at /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf.
If this is a first install, you can copy one from /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb/2.0.3-x86_64/mongod.conf:
cp /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb/2.0.3-x86_64/mongod.conf /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf
