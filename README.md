#Node Wiki

This was formally a proof of concept of easily combing Aloha editor with a node backend to achieve a simple wiki. This project has now started to evolve into a decent wiki platform with tags, recent pages, autosaving and drag and drop file uploads.

Contrary to other wikis you simply type an URL and if the page does not exist, edit it and you have created a new page.

##Installation

    git clone git@github.com:thomaspeklak/node-wiki.git
    cd node-wiki
    npm install
    node app.js

Then simply open http://localhsot:3000 and edit the page. Or go to another url and edit this page.

#Usage Guide

###Create new page

type an url that has not been used yet

###Upload Attachments

###Add images to content

- drag and drop image files from your computer into the content area where you want the images to appear
- drag an image url from the Images side bar box or from another website to the content area.
